            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">So what exactly is SEO</h1>
            <p>
              We often hear the term get thrown around alot, SEO, but what even is it? Well, SEO stands for Search
              Engine Optimization. But more importantly, SEO is basically a series of strategies to use in order to get
              your website to show up on the almighty google search. So when people are looking for your website or
              similar things to what your business or website offers they can actually find you on the google listings.
              Why is this important you ask? Well, in today&#39;s digital-first world, the everyone is trying to stand
              out online and it is currently more intense than ever. Businesses, ranging from startups to large
              corporations, are vying for that coveted top spot on search engine results pages.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Organic Traffic</h2>
            <p>
              Organic traffic refers to the visitors who land on your website through unpaid, natural search engine
              results. Unlike paid traffic generated through advertising, organic traffic is driven by the relevance and
              quality of your website&#39;s content, as well as its search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. It
              represents users who actively seek out information, products, or services and discover your website
              through their online searches. Organic traffic is highly valuable as it indicates genuine interest from
              potential customers and reflects the effectiveness of your website&#39;s SEO strategy in attracting and
              engaging with your target audience. By consistently delivering valuable content and optimizing for
              relevant keywords, businesses can increase their organic traffic, expand their online presence, and
              ultimately drive sustainable growth.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Understanding SEO: The Basics</h2>
            <p>
              SEO is a multifaceted, dynamic digital marketing strategy aimed at improving your website&#39;s visibility
              in search engine results. When potential customers search for products or services related to your
              business, you want your website to appear prominently in the results. SEO involves optimizing your online
              content so that a search engine likes to show it as a top result for searches of a certain keyword.
